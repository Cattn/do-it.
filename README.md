## What is this?

**do it!** isn't just another run-of-the-mill task app. It combines entertainment with productivity. Set your own tasks, outline everything you need to do. Then as you complete your tasks, earn rewards in a cookie-clicker like game for your effort. The more tasks you complete, the more rewards you earn! All wrapped in a sleek, material-3 inspired design.

## How does it work?
Create tasks, complete them, earn points! For every 4 points you get, you earn a "task". You can then spend tasks to unlock cool upgrades in the game.

In the future, tasks will be worth varying amounts based on the level of "effort" required for a task you set, & special notifications and rewards will be granted upon completion.

## Roadmap/Plans

- Friends & Server integration
    - Compete with your friends, sharing scores & seeing who is the most productive!
- AI "proof" checking
    - For select tasks, you can require yourself to submit "proof" of completion, holding yourself accountable & preventing cheating. (This will be optional)
- Enhanced Tasks
    - Have something you know you need to do? Not sure where to start on it, or how to break it up? Click "Enhance" and AI will help break the task up into more digestable pieces for you.
- Custom Animations & Icons
    - I plan to add even more fun animations, as well as cool icons that represent certain features!
- More Settings
    - Added settings, relating to AI, privacy, & server features will be coming soon! Initial, QOL focused settings will be present.
- And even more...!
